# app-reset.css
A minimal CSS reset specifically for web applications

## Why use app-reset.css?
Every time I make something 'appy' I have to switch off or reset a bunch of user agent styles so that I can use the correct element for the job at hand but style it inline with the project I'm building.

App-reset is intended specifically for web applications.
